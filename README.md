# Interview-Prep

This is targetted towards someone who has already worked for a few years and is looking to switch jobs.
To someone who knows what has to be done, but is not able to do it consistently.

There are 2 sections basically:
1. Preparation  
3. Interviewing  

The first one is the largest section.

## Preparation

### Consistent hours everyday
- No extra hours on weekends:
  If I do extra hours on weekends, I would start procastinating on weekdays, thinking that I can make up for it on weekends.
- I don't study if I get a 10 mins break in office. I just relax and take a break. Minimum block of time is 1 hour.

### Zero distractions
- No phone, no music, no TV, no people around.
- No going for snacks in the middle, everything should have been taken care beforehand.
- Never start hungry.

### Early morning
- Wake up at 5:00 AM.
- Waking up in the initial days is the hardest part. No snoozing.
- Try QR alarm, paste the QR code in the bathroom. You have to scan the QR code to stop the alarm.
- No checking phone for office emails or messages after waking up. This will make me anxious.
- If I miss waking up, I never cover it up by studying later in the day. I just miss it so that I can wake up early the next day.
- Morning study will give you a sense of accomplishment and will make you feel throughout the day that you have already done something productive.
- Evening/Night study is not as effective as morning study. You are tired and you have already done a lot of work in the day. You will not be able to concentrate.
- Evening/Night creates anxiety. You will be thinking about the study the whole day and you will be anxious about it. You will not be able to enjoy the day.
- Evening/Night mood will depend on how your day went. If you had a bad day, you will not be able to study effectively.
- Sleep at 10:00 PM.

### Track progress
- Keep track of these on a per day basis:
  - Number of hours studied.
  - Number of questions solved.
  - Names of topics studied.
- Put them in a paper and paste on the wall.
- It will warn you if you are slowing down.
- These metrics will be helpful even during the next preparation. You will now have metrics to compare against. 

### No e-books, No e-notes
- I will only study from physical books, no e-books.
- If I want to write some explanation, I write in the book itself.
- Any other notes I want to make, I write in a physical notebook.
- If I want to remember something, it goes to Anki. (see the next section)
- With digital notes, I end up spending most of the time in formatting and organizing the notes.
- I write in A4 size with 0.7mm mechanical pencil. 
- A4 size has very good height and breadth especially. I spiral bind around 50 sheets of A4 size and use it as a notebook.
- With pencil, you can make diagrams easily and you can erase easily, unlike pens.
- When reading a material, if you get some doubts on something, don't start googling it. Just write it down in the notebook. You can google it at the end.
  - Googling in the middle will make you lose focus, and you will end up reading something else.
  - In many cases your doubt will be cleared when you read further.

### Revision
- Revision is key to remembering.
- I tried Leitner box first, to stay offline and to avoid distractions. But it became hard to manage with a lot of cards.
- Use Anki, learn how to use it.
- Just make cards for anything you want to remember:
  - Algorithms
  - Concepts
  - Key Ideas
  - Definitions
  - Formulas

### Meditate and relax
- I chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra for 1 round (108 times) before starting the study in the morning.
- Relax on weekends. Spend time with family and friends.
- Study only when you sit for study. Don't think about study/concepts when you are not studying.

### Leetcode
- Buy Premium
- The standard questions have very good official editorials. They explain various solutions with diagrams and code.
- They are even updated/improved over time.
- It's not worth spending time on the solutions/discuss section. Half of it is trolls and comments saying 
  - 'ohh this solution is better than the most voted two liner solution'
  - 'ohh the difficulty level of this question is wrong'
  - '(suggests some improvement on the given solution)'
  - 'ohh will this test case pass'
- Solve without seeing the solution first.
- I solved around 100 questions.

### Mix everything
- Don't do Leetcode for 2 months, then do system design for the next 1 month. You will start forgetting Leetcode by the time you finish system design. This will cause panic.
- Don't do all Binary search problems in one week, 3 weeks down the line you will forget most of them.
- Also solving questions from the same topic in a row will make you remember the solution, not the concept. It will also make the questions look easier, deceptively.
- Easiest is to make a list of problems to solve and just solve them in random order.
- Install uBlock Origin, learn to use element picker. Remove all distractions from the page like: difficult, tags, votes, acceptance rate etc. These will make you biased towards the question.

### Don't mix planning and execution
- When you sit for study, you should already know what you are going to study.
- Don't study for 30 mins and then think what to study next.
- Spend some dedicated time for planning, it's a fun activity.

## During the interview
- Keep your phone away. Many times I received calls during the interview, I take my phone to end the call, subconsciously check who called, and start thinking why they called. It's a huge distraction.
- Have some water to drink nearby.
- Talk, Talk, Talk - You can improve on it by giving mock interviews.
- Make it fun. After all, it's boring for the interviewer as well to sit for an hour.
- You can talk about similar problems, similar algos you have seen/used.
- Talk like you are explaining to a friend.
- Keep in mind - Nobody can clear every single interview round they give. Learn from the mistakes and move on.
